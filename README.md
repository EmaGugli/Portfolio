# Portfolio
A collection of projects I have worked on during my master's degree and free time:
- **NLP**: A project that reads text from PDF and images and extracts named entities using pretrained models.
- **digital_epidemiology**: An analysis that identifies the putative genes responsible of breast cancer.
- **find_shortest_route**: A project that finds and helps visualize the shortes route between places in California using google maps.
